    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey! My name is Raj Patel and I am in computer programming. I am here at Humber to learn a new discipline which
        will eventually help me make a shift in my career.
        My hobbies include; Cycling, listening to music, and hiking.
        I was born in Montreal and have lived here throughout my entire life. There are a lot of things to do here and I
        always appreciate the number of diverse activities and entertainment my hometown has to offer.
